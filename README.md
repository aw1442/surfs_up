## Overview of the analysis

## Summary

As an overview of the results, the overall temperature for June is generally higher than December with less standard deviation at 3.26 compared to the standard deviation for December at 3.75. Two additional queries to gather more data for June and December could be:

- Number of days of rain per month to determine if a lot of rainy days may affect the number of ice cream customers
- Wind speed for each day of the month to determine if a lot of windy days may affect the number of ice cream customers
